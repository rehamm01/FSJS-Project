Code Louisville FSJS Project:
# KY Art Inventory

An Inventory for art-lovers to browse works of art contained in museums located in the state of Kentucky.

<br>

Progress:
1. Lightbox functionality removed. Artwork Entries are now on their own pages based on unique ID number.
2. Fixed problem with Select Inputs not registering selection.
3. Edit button working now that each Art Entry has it's own page.
4. Fixed Delete Button bug
5. Category Nav now functioning.
6. Placeholder images now loading.

Current Objectives:
1. Fix bug with 2nd Edit button click not filling out form with updated info.
2. Fix bug with Image being deleted after second Edit.

Future Objectives:
1. Include a Search Functionality so Users can Search the database by keyword.
2. As the Inventory grows, it would be nice if only a few Entries loaded at first. Then as the user scrolls, more could appear. This would cut back on page weight when the site first loads.
3. Improve site Accessibility: refine Keyboard navigation and include an "Artwork Description" field in the Submit Form and Database for users with vision-impairments.
