Code Louisville FSJS Project:
# KY Art Inventory

An Inventory for art-lovers to browse works of art contained in museums located in the state of Kentucky.

<br>

How to run this application:
1. In your Terminal, clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/rehamm01/FSJS-Project
cd FSJS-Project
``` 
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
``` 
3. Begin the app server process:
```
npm start
``` 
4. In a new terminal tab, start Mongo:
```
mongod
``` 
5. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3030
6. Enjoy Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting entries from the Ky Art Inventory!

Future Goals:
1. Include a Search Functionality so Users can Search the database by keyword.
2. As the Inventory grows, it would be nice if only a few entries loaded at first. Then as the user scrolls, more could appear. This would cut back on page weight when the site first loads. (Very important on mobile devices!)
3. Improve site Accessibility: refine Keyboard navigation and include an "Artwork Description" field in the Submit Form/Database so users with vision-impairments can still enjoy the site.
